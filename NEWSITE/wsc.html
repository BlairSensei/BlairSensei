            <p>Next I made a storyboard to show some for the struggles Karen, the primary persona,

        <p>Karen just moved to the city and doesn’t know many people her age. She finishes
        babysitting her grandson around 5:00 PM on weekdays, but is free most evenings.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She decides to look for a cooking class to try and meet some people. She goes to the
        Williams-Sonoma page to look for cooking classes in her area, but can’t find a way to sign
        up for classes on their site.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She becomes very frustrated, but eventually finds the phone number for the local store.
        She calls and registers for a cooking class. She meets some new people and has fun at the
        cooking class, but wishes there was an easier way to get information, network with other
        people, and sign up for cooking classes online.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>I found six people to do a card sorting activity, which helped me see how people would
        organize the pages of the site. This gave me insight into the information architecture of
        the new site. Once completed with my new sitemap, I began sketching wireframes and
        navigation elements.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-12">
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>Usability testing was done once the first prototype iteration was complete. The testing
        showed that users we able to easily find the needed information about local cooking classes
        and sign up for them. They also enjoyed seeing if people in their friends network were
        signed up for classes. Through my research I saw that people were more likely to sign up
        for a cooking class if someone they knew was also going to attend. Having this information
        readily available was very important. Some problems with the current navigation system were
        also found, which were fixed in the next prototype iteration.</p><br>

        <h3>Karen's Solution</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Karen is now able to quickly and easily sign up for cooking classes with her new
        friends. She also has a great online resource for recipes and can try out lots of new
        products in her classes before she decides to buy. All is good in the world.</p>

            </div>
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>Since networking is important to most people interested in taking cooking classes,
        integrating the site with other social networking sites or apps is something many of the
        people tested asked for.</p>
        <p>Testing with more people with limited technical knowledge in the next round of testing
        would be very helpful, as Williams-Sonoma is a high-end brand with an older demographic.
        All of the people involved in the first round of usability testing were comfortable with
        computers and technology, and testing people with a wider range of technical ability is
        needed.</p>
