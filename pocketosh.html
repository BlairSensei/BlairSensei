            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>Fellows Robots, a robotics company at the forefront of incorporating robotic assistants into the retail space, has developed a fully autonomous robot called NAVii. These robots give customers information about products, tell you where they are located in stores, and lead you to directly to the product. Unfortunately, Fellow Robots currently has no mobile presence and would like a way for customers to learn how to use NAVii in a retail environment, in particular OSHbot. OSHbots are the robots working in Orchard Supply Hardware home improvement and gardening stores.</p>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p>While the OSHbot robot is quite simple to use, many people do not have much experience interacting with robot. A number of people that were interviewed had a number of reservations using such a robot. Because this is a quite new experience for many people, having a simple way to educate people about OSHbots could increase the number of people interacting with them.</p>

                <h3>The Team</h3>
                <p>For this project I worked with two other UX designers, Cathrine Harrell and Jon Infranco. The three of us shared the load in the UX process.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Approach</h3>
                <p>First my team and I did organizational and domain research. While we didn't have a chance to interact with an OSHbot, we did call a store that has one and got some very good information. Interview screeners were then sent out to find the people we were looking to interview. My colleague and I compiled the data from the interviews we conducted and began making artifacts to make sense of all the information we gathered.</p>

        <br>


                <p>From this data we were found a number of persona, the primary persona being Olivia.</p>

                <p>My team and I created a scenario for Olivia which I later illustrated.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Olivia gets home after a long day at the office. She had to deal with a lot more clients than normal today and is really looking forward to relaxing in front of the TV this evening.</p>

                <p>When she gets home and unlocks the door she remembers she was supposed to go to Orchard Supply Hardware to replace her husband's lost key. As she is leaving she notices a couple lights out and adds them to the shopping list.</p>

                <p>As she drives to the store, she dreads the thought of more human interaction today.</p>

                <p>When she enters the store, she realized she has no clue where to go and that this trip to the store will take a lot longer that she hoped.</p>

                <p>We then held a charrette (or design studio) to help us focus our efforts with the structure and functionality of the app. From the design studio I came up with the idea to make the app a companion of OSHbot and converse with the user through use of speech bubbles. I felt this would help put users who were weary of using OSHbot at ease by using the pocketOSH app as a way to bridge the gap between them.</p>

            <p>Wireframes and our first itteration of the prototype were made in Axure. I made most of the navigation and icons for the pages and was in charge of illustrating and setting up the "About OSHbot" page on the app. User testing of the prototype proved to be very useful. One big issue we had was people had trouble understanding that the pocketOSH app and OSHbot robot were two different entities in the "About OSHbot" section of the app. The dialog was simplified to make it more clear, and I made the speech bubbles show in a way that make it seem more like a back-and-forth conversation.</p>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p>Most people were able to learn about the features of OSHbot robot buy using the pocketOSH application. There was still a bit of confusion about the navigation bar and some of the other navigation within the products and services pages. More card sorting, site map revisions and UI changes may be needed to improve the user flow through the app.</p>
                <br>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
                <p>Further interviews and user testing will be needed to see if a wider range of people are being helped by the app and learning how to interact with OSHbot from it. The number of searched being conducted on the app, rate of people using the OSHbot robot, as well as other success metrics must be taken into account.</p>
