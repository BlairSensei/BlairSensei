        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>Fellows Robots, a robotics company at the forefront of incorporating robotic
          assistants into the retail space, has developed a fully autonomous robot called NAVii.
          These robots give customers information about products, tell you where they are located
          in stores, and lead you directly to the product. Unfortunately, Fellow Robots currently
          has no mobile presence and would like a way for customers to learn how to use NAVii in a
          retail environment, in particular OSHbot. OSHbots are the robots working in Orchard
          Supply Hardware home improvement and gardening stores.</p><br>
          <p>While the OSHbot robot is quite simple to use, many people do not have much experience
          interacting with robots. A number of people that were interviewed had reservations using
          such a robot. Because this is a quite new experience for many people, having a simple way
          to educate people about OSHbots could increase the number of people interacting with
          them.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Approach</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>First my team and I did organizational and domain research. While we didn't have a
          chance to interact with an OSHbot, we did call a store that has one and got some very
          good information. Interview screeners were then sent out to find the people we were
          looking to interview. My colleagues and I compiled the data from the interviews we
          conducted and began making artifacts to make sense of all the information we
          gathered.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6"><img alt=

          <h3>Persona</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <p>From this data we were made two personas, the primary persona being Olivia.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12"><img alt=
        "Photograph and information about the primary persona, Olivia." class="img-responsive" src=

          <h3>Scenario</h3><!-- Image Header -->
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12">
              <p>My team and I created a scenario for Olivia which I later illustrated.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12"><img alt="Storyboard illustrating the scenario." class=
            "img-responsive" src="images/pocketosh/osh_sb.jpg"></div>
          </div>
          <p>Olivia gets home after a long day at the office. She had to deal with a lot more
          clients than normal today and is really looking forward to relaxing in front of the TV
          this evening.</p><br>
          <p>When she gets home and unlocks the door she remembers she was supposed to go to
          Orchard Supply Hardware to replace her husband's lost key. As she is leaving she notices
          a couple lights out and adds them to the shopping list.</p><br>
          <p>As she drives to the store, she dreads the thought of more human interaction
          today.</p>
          <p>When she enters the store, she realized she has no clue where to go and that this trip
          to the store will take a lot longer than she hoped.</p><br>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>We then held a charrette (or design studio) to help us focus our efforts on the
          structure and functionality of the app. It was during this design studio that we had one
          of our big breakthroughs with the app. Many people were weary of interacting with a
          customer service robot, so we knew we had to use the pocketOSH app as a means for the
          customers to “dip their toes in the water”. My idea was to have the OSHbot robot and
          pocketOSH app “talk” to each other through the use of speech bubbles. We hoped that by
          giving the app and robot personality, more people would be open to using the OSHbot robot
          in the store.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6"><img alt=

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p>Wireframes and our first iteration of the prototype were made in Axure. I made most of
          the navigation and icons for the pages and was in charge of illustrating and setting up
          the "About OSHbot" page on the app. User testing of the prototype proved to be very
          useful. One big issue we had was people had trouble understanding that the pocketOSH app
          and OSHbot robot were two different entities in the "About OSHbot" section of the app.
          The dialog was simplified to make it more clear, and I changed the speech bubbles to
          display in a way that made it seem more like a back-and-forth conversation.</p><br>

          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most people were able to learn about the features of OSHbot by using the pocketOSH
          application. There was still a bit of confusion about the navigation bar and some of the
          other navigation within the products and services pages. More card sorting, site map
          revisions and UI changes may be needed to improve the user flow through the app.</p><br>

          <p>Thanks to pocketOSH, Olivia has now found that shopping may not be as terrible as she

          <p>Further interviews and user testing will be needed to see if a wider range of people

          <p>The number of searches being conducted on the app, rate of people using the OSHbot
          robot, as well as other success metrics must be taken into account.</p>
