      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>OrbSense is a technology startup specializing in IOT (Internet of Things) products.
        Their first product, Cluck, is a smart kitchen timer that connects to a phone or tablet
        application and helps people boil food. Cluck does a very good job of helping boil eggs,
        OrbSense is looking to implement a number of new features including:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding a pasta cooking feature with a way to search for different types of
          pasta</li>
          <li>Implementing a feedback system to the app that helps people improve their cooking
          with Cluck</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>First, my team did organizational and domain research. While there are many kitchen
        devices that help people with timing and temperature measurement, Cluck is the only smart
        device that can be put into a pot to measure water temperature while boiling
        foods.</p><br>
        <p>From the 25 interview screeners we sent out, 17 interview candidates were found. From
        those interviews, the design team and I made an affinity diagram to find common trends in
        the data. That data was then used to make the persona we would be designing the app
        for.</p><br>

        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p>Caleb Brown, the primary persona, was made from our interview data and affinity

        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>Next I created a scenario for Caleb. This shows the problems he is currently having
        with his pasta cooking process, which I later illustrated.</p><img alt=

        <h3>The Pasta Problem</h3>
        <p>One of the largest challenges of this project was finding a way to sort pastas in a
        way that users can easily understand. The number of different types of pasta is almost
        limitless. We conducted a card sorting exercise to help us see how users thought pastas
        would be sorted. From our findings, we found that most people sorted pasta by shape and
        size. While this sounds like a simple solution, the cook times of pastas with similar
        shapes can vary wildly. Two ways of finding pasta cook times were made to better server
        the needs of the user.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>searchable pasta list sorted by pasta shapes and sizes</li>
          <li>barcode scanner that allows users to quickly get cook times from a product
          database</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12"><img alt="Chart of the pasta grouping card sort data." class=
      "img-responsive" src="images/cluck/cluck_pasta.jpg"></div>

    <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3>UI and Prototype</h3>
        <p>During the three week sprint, the user interface went through multiple rounds of iterations based on user testing. The team worked
        together on the initial design. These sketches were then made into a paper prototype that was put into
        POP for user testing.

        Once testing of the first prototype was complete, a digital prototype made using Illustrator, Sketch and Invision. I was in charge of making most of the graphics, icons, and making the prototypeâ€™s visuals consistent throughout all pages.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-12">

        <h3>Testing and User Needs Findings</h3>
        <p>Three rounds of testing were done for this project. These tests were done on the the
        current app using the cluck device, the paper prototype and the high-fidelity prototype. The
        number of tests done are as follows:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>cluck device with the &nbsp;existing app - 7 tests</li>
          <li>Paper prototype - 10 tests</li>
          <li>High-Fidelity prototype - 12 tests</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>In these tests, we tried to solve for a number of key areas that continually arose:</p>
        <ul><br>
        <li>voice and tone: After seeing the cluck device, users felt there was a disconnect between the look of the device and the feel of the current app. Making the app more light and friendly was something many users wanted. We found that users were more likely to try using Cluck if the experience of using the app was more fun and personal.</li>
        <li>clear instructions in a timely manner: In the existing application, all cooking instructions are given before the cooking process begins. Users wanted the instructions to be given at the time they needed to do each step. This allowed the users to focus on what they needed to do while not needing to memorize the entire process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Further usability testing will be needed once the new app changes are implemented.</p>
        <p>Further development of the feedback system that helps the app improve is necessary.
        Having the app be able to learn and/or improve is very important to the people we have
        tested.</p>
