            <h3><b>The Challenge</b></h3>
                <p>OrbSense is a technology startup specializing in IOT (Internet of Things) products. Their first product, Cluck, is a smart kitchen timer that connects to a phone or tablet application and helps people boil food. Cluck does a very good job of helping boil eggs, OrbSense is looking to implement a number of new features including:
                 <ul>
                    <li>Add a pasta cooking feature with a way to search for different types of pasta</li>
                    <li>Implement a feedback system to the app that helps people improve their cooking with Cluck</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><b>The Approach</b></h3>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>First, my team did organizational and domain research. While there are many kitchen devices that help people with kitchen timing and temperature measurement, Cluck is the only smart device that can measure water temperature while boiling foods.</p>
                <p>
                From the 25 interview screeners we sent out, 17 interview candidates were found. From those interviews, the design team and I made an affinity diagram to find common trends in the data. That data was then used to make the persona we would be designing the app for.

                <p>Caleb is finally ready to make some dinner and relax in front of the TV after a long day. He is looking forward to having some nice food while watching his favorite show on TV.</p>

                <p>He puts some water on to boil, but suddenly realizes the show has already started. He runs over to switch the TV on.</p>

                <p>Continually having to check if the water is boiling yet, Caleb has to go back and forth to the kitchen and misses a lot of the show. When it’s time to put the pasta in, he checks the cook time on the box, sets a timer and returns to the TV in the other room.When she enters the store, she realized she has no clue where to go and that this trip to the store will take a lot longer that she hoped.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/cluck/cluck_sb02.jpg" alt="Storyboard illustrating the scenario.">
                <p>As he is watching TV in the other room, he doesn’t hear the timer go off. The next commercial break, he goes back to the kitchen to find that his spaghetti was mushy because it had cooked too long.</p>

                <p>Caleb wishes there was a way to prepare food well while not having to constantly go back to the kitchen to check his food.</p>

            <h3><b>The Solution</b></h3>
                <h3>The Pasta Problem</h3>
                <p>One of the largest challenges of this project was finding a way to sort pastas in a way that users can easily understand. The number of different types of pasta is almost limitless. We conducted a card sorting exercise to help us see how users though pastas would be sorted. From our findings, we found that most people sorted pasta by shape and size. While this sounds like a simple solution, the cook times of pastas with similar shapes can vary wildly. Two ways of finding pasta cook times were made to better server the needs of the user.
                    <ul>
                    <li>searchable pasta list sorted by pasta shapes and sizes</li>
                    <li>barcode scanner that allows users to quickly get cook times from a product database</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>During the three week sprint, two prototype iterations were made. The team worked together on the design of both apps. The first was a paper prototype that was put into POP. The second was a digital prototype made using Illustrator, Sketch and put into Invision.  As I had the most design experience among our team members, I was in charge of making most of the graphics, icons, and making the prototype’s visuals consistent throughout all pages.</p>

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>Three rounds of testing were done for this project. These tests were done on the the current app and cluck device, the paper prototype and the high-fidelity prototype. The number of tests done are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>cluck device with the  existing app - 7 tests</li>
                    <li>Paper prototype - 10 tests</li>
                    <li>High-Fidelity prototype - 12 tests</li>

                <p>Testers found the final prototype easy to navigate and thought the cooking process was clear and easy to follow.
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing a strategy around the pasta and favorites databases</li>
                    <li>Usability testing with the new app changes</li>
