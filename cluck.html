        <h3><b>The Challenge</b></h3>
        <p>OrbSense is a technology startup specializing in IOT (Internet of Things) products.
        Their first product, Cluck, is a smart kitchen timer that connects to a phone or tablet
        application and helps people boil food. Cluck does a very good job of helping boil eggs,
        OrbSense is looking to implement a number of new features including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding a pasta cooking feature with a way to search for different types of pasta</li>
          <li>Implementing a feedback system to the app that helps people improve their cooking
          with Cluck</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6"><img alt="Cluck device on a kitchen counter." class="img-responsive"

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3><b>The Approach</b></h3>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>First, my team did organizational and domain research. While there are many kitchen
        devices that help people with timing and temperature measurement, Cluck is the only smart
        device that can be put into a pot to measure water temperature while boiling foods.</p>
        <p>From the 25 interview screeners we sent out, 17 interview candidates were found. From
        those interviews, the design team and I made an affinity diagram to find common trends in
        the data. That data was then used to make the persona we would be designing the app
        for.</p>

    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <p>Caleb Brown, the primary persona, was made from our interview data and affinity
    diagraming.</p><br>

        <p>Next I created a scenario for Caleb. This shows the problems he is currently having with
        his pasta cooking process, which I later illustrated.</p>

        <img alt="Storyboard illustrating the scenario." class="img-responsive" src=
        "images/cluck/cluck_sb01.jpg">
        <p>Caleb is finally ready to make some dinner and relax in front of the TV after a long
        day. He is looking forward to having some nice food while watching his favorite show.</p>
        <p>He puts some water on to boil, but suddenly realizes the show has already started. He
        runs over to switch the TV on.</p>
        <p>Continually having to check if the water is boiling yet, Caleb has to go back and forth
        to the kitchen and misses a lot of the show. When it’s time to put the pasta in, he checks
        the cook time on the box, sets a timer and returns to the TV in the other room.</p>

        <img alt="Storyboard illustrating the scenario." class="img-responsive" src=
        "images/cluck/cluck_sb02.jpg">
        <p>As he is watching TV in the other room, he doesn’t hear the timer go off. The next
        commercial break, he goes back to the kitchen to find that his spaghetti is mushy because
        it had cooked too long.</p>
        <p>Caleb wishes there was a way to prepare food well while not having to constantly go back
        to the kitchen to check on it.</p>

        <h3><b>The Solution</b></h3>
        <h3>The Pasta Problem</h3>
        <p>One of the largest challenges of this project was finding a way to sort pastas in a way
        that users can easily understand. The number of different types of pasta is almost
        limitless. We conducted a card sorting exercise to help us see how users thought pastas
        would be sorted. From our findings, we found that most people sorted pasta by shape and
        size. While this sounds like a simple solution, the cook times of pastas with similar
        shapes can vary wildly. Two ways of finding pasta cook times were made to better server the
        needs of the user.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>searchable pasta list sorted by pasta shapes and sizes</li>
          <li>barcode scanner that allows users to quickly get cook times from a product
          database</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>During the three week sprint, two prototype iterations were made. The team worked
        together on the design of both apps. The first was a paper prototype that was put into POP.
        The second was a digital prototype made using Illustrator, Sketch and put into Invision. As
        I had the most design experience among our team members, I was in charge of making most of
        the graphics, icons, and making the prototype’s visuals consistent throughout all
        pages.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>Three rounds of testing were done for this project. These tests were done on the the
      current app and cluck device, the paper prototype and the high-fidelity prototype. The number
      of tests done are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>cluck device with the &nbsp;existing app - 7 tests</li>
        <li>Paper prototype - 10 tests</li>
        <li>High-Fidelity prototype - 12 tests</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Valuable data was gathered from each round of testing that helped the team improve upon
      the next iteration of the prototype.</p>

        <h3><b>The Next Steps</b></h3>
        <p>Further usability testing will be needed once the new app changes are implemented.</p>
        <p>Further development of the feedback system that helps the app improve is necessary.
        Having the app be able to learn and/or improve is very important to the people we have
        tested.</p>
