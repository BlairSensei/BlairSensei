I am a User Experience Designer who puts people first. With a background in graphic design and years of teaching experience, I am no stranger to problem solving. I love to make meaningful experiences and hopefully can make the world a better and happier place. I also enjoy drawing, practicing Japanese, and I have an unhealthy addiction to denim.
