            <p>I was tasked with designing the Attendance module for an existing restaurant management software suite. This module would allow staff to clock in and out for work, request vacation/off days, and let managers see if staff have been coming in on time or working too much. Attendance would work in conjunction with the existing Shift module, which managers and upper level staff use to set employee schedules. I worked with our team’s lead UX designer to be sure this new module would work well with existing modules she had already created. Feedback from the product owner was also crucial to making sure we delivered tools that the clients needed.</p><br>

            <p>When I began working on visuals of employee clock times, we quickly noticed that breaks were complicating things. If someone works, they are usually required by law to take breaks. How will we display breaks? We decided to add an adjustable break field to the Shift module. When a manager sets up a store’s schedule, they enter the amount of break time the employees will take. Attendance can then see that information and flag managers if employees are taking too many/or not enough breaks.</p><br>

            <p>For one of our customers, overwork was a serious concern. In their country, companies could be severely punished if their employees worked over the set number of hours decided by the government. Making sure their staff were not working more than the allowed work hours was crucial. We made sure management tools showed overwork and underwork, as well as projected hours due to work routines. They also needed the basic functions of accepting/denying requested time off, and adding manual clock times (if a worker forgets to clock in or out).</p>

          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>One of our customers had an issue with their current clocking system. Some employees were clocking in for other coworkers to:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><p>take their shifts without permission from management</p></li>
                  <li><p>clocking in for coworkers who are late to work</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>We added a step in the clock process that would take a photograph of the employee’s face for each clock in. When a manager verifies the clock times at the end of the day, they can go in and check the photos to see if employees had actually clocked in. The photos are deleted once a manager approves the clock times, which was necessary for privacy reasons, as well as kept the system from having the data of all those clock photos.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Time sheets were very important for the managers. They needed a way to look through a lot of data, and being able to filter through it was vital. We made a system that flags employees who are clocking in too early or not clocking out on time. The time sheet will display in red data that is out of the set threshold, so managers can easily see which employees are having issues. Employees with no overwork or underwork in a set time can be filtered out.

              <p>Verifying multiple check in photographs for multiple employees each day may take a lot of time. To speed up their work flow, we have had discussion of an alternative verification method such as fingerprint or facial scanning. Further research must be made to determine what method would work best, and would require the least new hardware to implement.</p>
