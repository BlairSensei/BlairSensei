                <h3><b>The Challenge</b></h3>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Williams-Sonoma is an American lifestyle brand specializing in high-end kitchen supplies and home products. While their web stores and brick and mortar stores are very popular, they are lacking a web presence for their in-store cooking classes. There is currently no way to sign up for or get information about cooking classes. By improving the cooking class web presence, Williams-Sonoma is hoping to improve the process of finding, signing up for, taking cooking classes, and ultimately buying more products.</p>

                <h3><b>The Approach</b></h3>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>My first step was doing market research, domain research and sending out interview screeners to find potential users of the Williams-Sonoma website. I then conducted interviews to find the needs and behaviors of the users in regards to cooking, their history with cooking classes, and the purchasing of kitchen products. I discovered that many people interviewed would be interested in taking a cooking class (mainly for the social aspect), most people purchased products online, and that product reviews are very important to kitchen product buyers.</p>

                <p>Karen just moved to the city and doesn’t know many people her age. She finished babysitting her grandson around 5:00 PM on weekdays, but is free most evenings.</p>

                <p>She decides to look for a cooking class to try and meet some people. She goes to the Williams-Sonoma page to look for cooking classes in her area, but can’t find a way to sign up for classes on their site.</p>

                <p>She becomes very frustrated, but eventually finds the phone number for the local store. She calls and registers for a cooking class. She meets some new people and has fun at the cooking class, but wishes there was and easier way to get information, network with other people, and sign up for cooking classes online.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Next I found six people do a card sorting activity in order to see how people would expect a cooking materials site to be organized. This gave me insight into the information architecture of the new site. Once completed with my new sitemap, I began sketching wireframes and navigation elements.</p>

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>Usability testing was done once the first prototype iteration was complete. There testing showed users we able to easily find the needed information about local cooking classes and sign up for them. They also enjoyed seeing if people in their friends network were signed up for classes. Through my research I saw that people were more likely to sign up for a cooking class if someone they knew was also going to attend. Having this information readily available was very important. Some problems with the current navigation system were also found, which were fixed in the next prototype iteration.</p>

                <p>Karen is now able to quickly and easily sign up for cooking classes with her new friends. She also has a great online resource for recipes and can try out lots of new products in her classes before she decides to buy. All is good in the world.

                <h3><b>The Next Steps</b></h3>
                <p>Since networking is important to most people interested in taking cooking classes, integrating the site with other social networking sites or apps is something many of the people tested asked for.</p>

                <p>Testing with more people with limited technical knowledge in the next round of testing would be very helpful, as Williams-Sonoma is a high-end brand with an older demographic. All of the people involved in the first round of usability testing were comfortable with computers and technology, and testing people with a wider range of technical ability is needed.</p>
