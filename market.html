          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>I joined a team to work on a project in the cryptocurrency space. The main service of this company is to let users trade cryptocurrencies, as well as fiat currency (such as US Dollars) with cryptocurrency. I acted as the sole designer on this project, working on all levels of the design process. As I had no knowledge or experience with cryptocurrency, there was a lot of research and long talks with those on the team with experience in this field.</p>

            </section>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-7">
            <p>I worked closely with our product owners, compliance officers and risk managers, as well as did extensive competitor research to get the started on my design work. As I was doing research on other platforms, I noticed how most of these sites had a very high barrier for entry. I, being a newcomer to the crypto and trading world, was completely lost trying to make sense of all the numbers, graphs, and tables. Most other exchanges had little to no labeling of their interfaces, or any explanations to be found. To make matters worse, there seemed to be no standard terminology.  It seemed like some secret organization that I was not a part of, and was not allowed to join. I asked some of my coworkers how they had learned to use other crypto exchanges, and they told me the best way to learn was to look online for tutorials. Why do I have to leave a cryptocurrency site and hunt down someone else to teach me how to use their platform?</p>

            <p>We decided that our site should be powerful enough for seasoned traders, but provide guidance and information so newcomers could learn how to start trading. Clearly labeling the marketplace was the first step. How can people communicate about our site if there isn’t a common language?  We also made a tour that gives users brief explanations of each component of the marketplace and how they work. To explain some aspects of cryptocurrency and trading, a short explanation is not enough. We decided to create articles to explain the more complex processes that our users want to learn about. A live chat was also integrated into our site so people could get answers for any additional questions they may have.</p>

            <h3>Customization</h3>
            </section>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>After a number of interviews with active crypto traders, it quickly became apparent that they were very particular about their trading platforms. I got some very telling quotes interviewing traders:</p>
            <section id="space">
            </section>
            <h2>“I don’t use their site, because I hate their Order Book.”</h2>
            <h2>“I hate this exchange. The Order Form is on the left. It should be on the right.”</h2>
            <section id="space">
            </section>
            <p>
            In an effort to give all our users what they want, I got the idea of having a customizable marketplace. I spoke with the product owner about this concept, and we decided that this would be one of the ways we would differentiate our site from others in this market space. Working closely with our frontend developer, we broke the interface into a system of components. These components could be moved, resized or removed. There is a lot of information to display, so screen real estate is a premium. Customization will allow people to only have the components on screen they need. Want to move the Order Book to the other side of the screen? Want to pop out one component and move it to another monitor? Want the entire screen to be charts? You have the freedom to set up the marketplace however you like. We also gave users the ability to change the colors of the exchange and save multiple layouts.

            <p>Since the marketplace is where the users need to be to trade, we wanted to provide all the necessary functionality there. Most other crypto services require their users to go to a separate page to deposit or withdraw funds from their wallets. To keep our users where the action is, we added the ability to deposit and withdraw both crypto and fiat funds within the marketplace.</p>

            <p>The Order Form took quite a lot of work. This is the component where the buying and selling is happening. I had many meetings with the product owners, developers and other people with trading experience to figure out what information we needed to display. We offer a number of different order types, each which displays different figures and has different input fields. Figuring out how to effectively fit in all these fields in a small space took a lot of trial and error through many iterations.</p>
