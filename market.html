            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Cryptocurrency has grown in popularity in recent years. Low transaction fees, quick transfers and decentralization are attractive to many people, not to mention the potential for big returns on investments. While many crypto exchanges allow people to trade crypto for other crypto, not many allow for the purchase of cryptocurrency with fiat currency (government-issued currency such as the US Dollar or Euro).</p>
            <br>
            <p>I joined a cross-functional team to work on a project in the cryptocurrency space. The main service of this company is to let users trade cryptocurrencies, as well as fiat currency. I acted as the sole designer on this project, working on all levels of the research and design process. As I had no previous knowledge or experience with cryptocurrency, there was a lot of research and long talks with those on the team with experience in this field.

              As this was a brand new company, the first task assigned to me was to create the logo for the company. The CEO picked the name Binfinity, a portamento of “Bitcoin” (one of the first and most popular cryptocurrencies) and “Infinity”. I began sketching out ideas for our logomark. After some discussion with the CEO, I decided to merge the image of the infinity symbol and a block, to symbolize blockchain, the digital ledger technology that makes cryptocurrency trading possible.

              After the logo was finalized, the homepage and website were next. The CEO and I discussed his vision for the site, and the types of pages he wanted to include. I also worked with the compliance offices to be sure we included the necessary documentation and policy information. I started the information architecture work by creating a site map. Once I had the structure and general styling approved, I began designing the screen states for each page.

            <p>I worked closely with our team to understand the business needs of Binfinity. I had many interviews with product owners, compliance officers and risk managers, as well as did extensive competitor research to get started on my UX work. Due to time and budget constraints, I was not able to conduct interviews with end users, but I had regular discussions and got feedback from those on the team who did crypto trading.</p>

            <p>Getting new users to set up accounts for a new site is vital. Due to regulatory reasons, Binfinity requires their users to not only create an account, but also through a KYC (Know Your Customer) process. This is to make sure those using the platform are not involved in nefarious activities such as money laundering, organized crime or terrorism. Since the information required in this KYC process can seem rather invasive (photograph of passport or ID, proof of address, etc.), making this process as quick and painless as possible is essential. We ultimately decided on two options.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We ultimately decided to provide two options:</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Automated Verification</b> - We found a company that provides KYC services and worked together to create iOS and Android applications to help onboard our users. These apps can verify publicly issued identification, as well as use biometrics to make sure the person using the app is the same person in the ID. App verification can also automatically verify users in a few minutes</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Manual Verification</b> -  For those that do not have access to a smartphone or do not want to install a new app on their phone, we created a manual verification form on the website. These must be verified manually, so they will take longer to process.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>After a number of interviews with active crypto traders, it quickly became apparent that they were very particular about their trading platforms. Here are a few quotes about their thoughs on some other trading platforms:</p>
            <section id="space">
            </section>
            <h3>“I don’t use their site, because I hate their order book.”</h3>
            <section id="space">
            </section>
            <h3>“I hate this exchange. The Order Form is on the left. It should be on the right.”</h3>
            <section id="space">
            </section>
            <p>
            In an effort to give all our users what they want, I got the idea of having a customizable marketplace. I spoke with the product owner about this concept, and we decided that this would be one of the ways we would differentiate our site from others in this market space. Working closely with our frontend developer, we broke the interface into a system of components. These components could be moved, resized or removed. There is a lot of information to display, so screen real estate is a premium. Customization will allow people to only have the components on screen they need. Want to move the Order Book to the other side of the screen? Want to pop out one component and move it to another monitor? Want the entire screen to be charts? You have the freedom to set up the marketplace however you like. We also gave users the ability to change the colors of the exchange and save multiple layouts.

            <p>The Order Form took quite a lot of work. This is the component where the buying and selling is happening. I had many meetings with the product owners, developers and other people with trading experience to figure out what information we needed to display and how it should be arranged. We offer a number of different order types, each which displays different figures and has different input fields. Figuring out how to effectively fit in all these fields in a small space took a lot of trial and error through many iterations.</p>

            <p>I was asked by the CEO to work on the design for a native mobile app for our company. He saw that a number of other crypto exchanges had mobile applications, and he thought we should look into making our own as well. I began by doing some research on competitors' apps, as well as looking at current mobile best practices.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I began by creating some low fidelity wireframes of the needed functions that were to be brought to the mobile app from our site. From there I began designing high-fidelity  screen states for the entire mobile application.

            <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>The mobile app never made it out of the design stage. The development lead and I spoke to the CEO and explained that while a mobile app would be nice to have, the current web site was responsive and worked on both computers and mobile devices. At that point in the project, the value gained from the mobile app did not seem worth taking development time away from the main site or worth the cost of hiring a dedicated mobile team. The CEO ultimately agreed with us, and the mobile app was set as a stretch goal for our company.
