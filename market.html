            </section>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>I joined a team to work on a project in the cryptocurrency space. The main service of this company is to let users trade cryptocurrencies, as well as fiat currency (such as US Dollars) with cryptocurrency. I acted as the sole designer on this project, working on all levels of the design process. As I had no knowledge or experience of cryptocurrency, there was a lot of research and long talks with those on the team with experience in this field.</p>

            <h3>Barrier of Entry</h3>
            </section>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>I worked closely with our product owners, compliance officers and risk managers, as well as did extensive competitor research to get the started on my design work. As I was doing research on other platforms, I noticed how most of these sites had a very high barrier for entry. I, being a newcomer to the crypto world, was completely lost trying to make sense of all the numbers, graphs, and tables. Most other exchanges had little to no labeling of their interfaces, or any explanations to be found anywhere. I asked some of my coworkers how they had learned to use other crypto exchanges, and they told me the best way to learn was to look online for tutorials. Why do I have to leave these sites and go hunt down someone else to teach me how to use their service?</p>
            <br>
            <p>We decided that our site should be powerful enough for seasoned traders, but provide guidance and information so newcomers could learn how to start trading. Clearly labeling the marketplace was the first step. We also made a tour that gives users brief explanations of each component of the marketplace and how they work. Articles would be written to explain the more complex processes. A live chat was integrated into our site so people could get answers for any additional questions they may have.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>We realized pretty early on that people who traded were very particular about their trading platforms. We wanted to allow users to customize our marketplace to meet their specific needs. There is a lot of information to display, so screen real estate is a premium. Working closely with our frontend developer, we broke the interface into a system of components. These components could be moved, resized or removed. Want to move the Order Book to the other side of the screen? Want to pop out one component and move it to another monitor? Want the entire screen to be charts? You have the freedom to set up the marketplace however you like. We also gave users the ability to change the colors of the exchange and save multiple layouts.</p>

            <p>Since the marketplace is where the users need to be to trade, we wanted to provide all the necessary functionality there. Most other crypto services require their users to go to a separate page to deposit or withdraw funds from their wallets. To keep our users where the action is, we added the ability to deposit and withdraw both crypto and fiat funds within the marketplace.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>The Order Form took quite a lot of work. This is the component where the buying and selling is happening. I had many meetings with the product owners, developers and other people with trading experience to figure out what information we needed to display. We offer a number of different order types, each which displays different figures and has different input fields. Figuring out how to effectively fit in all these fields in a small space took a lot of trial and error through many iterations.
